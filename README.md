# Next.js 15 - Uninformative Error with Functional Component Return Type

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 related to functional component return types.  The issue is that when a functional component doesn't explicitly return a JSX element, Next.js throws an error that isn't immediately clear. The solution involves ensuring the component always returns a JSX element or `null` to make it obvious what is going on.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `pages` directory and run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the error in the browser console and the lack of informative messages.

## Solution

The solution is simple. If a component has conditional rendering and there is a branch that might not render anything, return `null` explicitly instead of implicitly returning undefined. This way the type system has no way of getting confused.

## Additional Notes

This issue highlights the importance of clear error messages in development environments.  Next.js 15 should provide more informative error messages to aid developers.
